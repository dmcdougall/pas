Petroleum Analytical Solutions
===============================



PAS is a collection of analytical and semi-analytical solutions for petroleum related problems.
The petroleum industry has a long history of developing analytical solutions 
for the kinds of Partial Differential Equations encountered in the industry. In addition to 
being used for benchmarking numerical codes, these solutions are often used 
on their own for research and engineering calculations. 

The code is still in early development. The current solutions available are:

* The Buckley-Leverett solution for water-flooding problems. 
* The Cinco-Ley Meng solution for finite conductivity fracture problem.
* One of the Thambynagam analytical solution to the diffusion problem over a bounded square domain.

The best way to get the code right now is to clone the git repo and run the setup utility:


    .. code-block:: bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/ohinai/pas.git
        $ python setup.py develop
